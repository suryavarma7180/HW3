    <h3>Description</h3>
    This assignment provides opportunities to use various CSS rules in a creative environment. The end product is a
    static website with modern styling.
    <h2>Website Requirements</h2>
    <p>In HW1 you created the contents of a static website using only HTML. Now your objective is to <strong>bring stylistic life</strong> to your site using CSS! You should <strong>consider the topic and theme</strong> to design appropriately.</p>
    <p>You are free to add additional HTML content to bring more completeness to your site. If you wish to choose a different topic than you submitted for HW1, you must create a new HTML structure that meets the standards of HW1.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Style a static web site</strong>, specifying <strong>at least 2 CSS rules</strong> from <strong>each</strong> of the following categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Background and Text Color</li>
        <li>Font Size and Style</li>
        <li>Spacing using Padding, Border, and Margin</li>
        <li>Layout</li>
        <li>Animation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While styling your site, you must <strong>use CSS preprocessing for at least 1 of the CSS files</strong> in your website. Include preprocessor files along with the compiled CSS files in your repository. You may use Sass or a CSS preprocessor of your choice to utilize advantages such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Variables and Math</li>
        <li>Nesting</li>
        <li>Partials, Modules, Mixins, and Inheritance</li>
        <li>If Statements, Loops, and Functions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use <strong>best practice</strong> for all CSS contents. Examples of best practice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use modern responsive layouts such as grid or flexbox</li>
        <li>Avoid using tables or br tags for layout and spacing</li>
        <li>Specify sizes with responsiveness in mind (minimal px values)</li>
        <li>Keep stylesheets DRY and organized</li>
    </ul>
